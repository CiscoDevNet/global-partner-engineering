## This script polls the cdFMC for all the managed FTDs and queries their current licenses
## It saves the output to an excel file
## As an input, we need two text files, one containing the baseurl and other containing the bearer token
## Do not change the name of the text files containing the baseURL and bearer token as they are being referenced in the script
## Install the python script dependencies before running the script
## You can get the baseURL from your CDO tenant, Tools & Service -> Firewall Management center -> Select Cloud-delivered FMC -> Hostname populated on the right-side(prefix it with https://)
