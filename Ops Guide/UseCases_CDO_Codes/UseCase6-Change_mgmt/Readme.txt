# This script asks for the name of the change request(case-sensitive) for which you want to pull the events.
# It saves the output to an excel file
# Also as an input, we need two more text files(baseURL.txt and bearer.txt) in the same path as the script, one containing the baseurl and other containing the bearer token
# Install the python dependencies before running the script
# There is no check on the existence of the change request tag, if the tag isn't found the output excel file will be empty
