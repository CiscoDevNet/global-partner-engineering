# Cisco Catalyst Center Application Health Retrieval

This Python code retrieves application health data from Cisco Catalyst Center and presents it in a structured format. Here's a summary of the code:

## Imports
- `CatalystCenter_auth`: This module likely contains functions for authenticating with the Cisco Catalyst Center API.
- `pprint`: A module for pretty-printing Python data structures.

## Functions

### `get_data()`

This function retrieves application health data from Cisco Catalyst Center and returns a list of dictionaries containing the following keys for each application:

- `name` (str): The name of the application.
- `events` (str): A string containing health score, packet loss percentage, network latency, and jitter values.
- `health` (str): The health status of the application, which is set to "critical" in this implementation.
- `url` (str): The URL to the application details in the Cisco Catalyst Center dashboard.

The function performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves a list of site IDs from the `/dna/intent/api/v1/site` endpoint.
2. For each site ID, retrieves application health data from the `/dna/intent/api/v1/application-health` endpoint.
3. Filters the application health data to include only applications with a health score less than 8 (indicating a critical state).
4. Formats the application health data into a dictionary with the required keys (`name`, `events`, `health`, `url`).
5. Appends the formatted application health data to a list.
6. Returns the list of application health data.

## Main Execution

If the script is run directly (not imported as a module), it calls the `get_data()` function and pretty-prints the resulting list of application health data using `pprint`.

## Dependencies

This code relies on the `CatalystCenter_auth` module for authentication and API interaction with Cisco Catalyst Center. It also assumes that the necessary authentication credentials and base URLs are defined within the `CatalystCenter_auth` module.
