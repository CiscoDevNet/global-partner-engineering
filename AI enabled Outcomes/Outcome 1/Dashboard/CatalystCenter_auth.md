This code is written in Python and is designed to interact with Cisco's DNA Center (DNAC) API. Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

1. The code starts with a copyright notice and license information from Cisco, stating that this software is licensed under the Cisco Sample Code License, Version 1.1.

2. The code imports necessary Python modules, such as `requests` for making HTTP requests, `time` for time-related operations, `urllib3` for disabling SSL/TLS certificate warnings, `pprint` for pretty-printing JSON data, and `credentials` for accessing the DNAC username and password.

3. The `BASE_URL` and `AUTH_URL` are defined, which represent the base URL of the DNAC instance and the authentication URL for obtaining an authentication token, respectively.

4. The `get_data` function is defined, which takes an `uri`, `header`, and `query` as input parameters. This function authenticates with DNAC using the provided credentials, obtains an authentication token, and then sends a GET request to the specified `uri` with the provided `header` and `query`. It handles rate-limiting errors (HTTP 429) by retrying after a delay of 60 seconds.

5. The `post_data` function is defined, which takes an `uri` and `body` as input parameters. Similar to `get_data`, it authenticates with DNAC and sends a POST request to the specified `uri` with the provided `body`. If the request is successful (HTTP 202), it returns the JSON response; otherwise, it prints an error message.

6. In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, the code demonstrates the usage of the `get_data` function by retrieving device health information from the DNAC API (`/dna/intent/api/v1/device-health`) and pretty-printing the response.

7. The code then iterates over the device health data and retrieves detailed information for each device by calling the `get_data` function with the `/dna/intent/api/v1/device-detail` URI and passing the device's MAC address as a query parameter.

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for interacting with the DNAC API, authenticating with the API, and retrieving and posting data using Python. It can be extended or modified as needed to perform various tasks related to managing and monitoring network devices and services through the DNAC API.
